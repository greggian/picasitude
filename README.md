Picasatude
==========
Picasatude is a sync tool between Google's Picasa Web Albums and Google's Latitude Geolocation service  

Why?
----
There are lots of photos that are instantly geo-tagged when taken by a smartphone or similar geo-aware device. This is great because you can come back to a picture and know exactly when and **where** it was taken. That kind of geo-tagging should be available for all of your photos, even if they were taken by a point-and-shoot or dslr. If you use latitude, the data is available and ready to use.

How?
----
Just head over to [Picasatude](http://picasatude.appspot.com). Follow the instructions that walk you through the process. (Coming soon?!)  

The process is pretty straightforward:

*  Give Picasatude access to your Picasa Web and Latitude information. We use oauth so Picasatude will never have your access credentials, that's between you and Google.  
*  Picasatude will grab a list of your albums so you can tell us which album you would like to geotag.  
*  We run through the photos in the album and find the best position from latitude. Updating picasa as we go!
